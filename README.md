# NailedIt
NailedIt by Tal Ohayon - sign up for manicure appointments!

"NailedIt" is a platform that helps women to schedule a manicure appointment at my girlfriend's "LackGel" studio. 
I built the platform using NodeJS, integrated it with 3rd party APIs such as MailChimp, and designed the UI components by myself using CSS.
